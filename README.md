# Ogre Router

This project hopes to create anonymous routing of data through the standard (chromium) browser.

It was inspired by Discord, Tor, node-Tor among others. The routing mechanism is inspired by Tor's onion routing, but is not exactly the same (which is why the name was changed to ogre, though they both have layers).

Currently still in the works and minimally functional.
